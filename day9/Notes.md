## Regex - Regular expressions

Incase if we are to detect a pattern we use **Regex**.
Inorder to test the regex we can use [Regex Test](https://regexr.com/) and for reference use [Reference](https://www.javatpoint.com/java-regex).
- In java inorder to mark the end of String it appends with '\Z' and in regex that '\Z'==$ so append $ to match each String. 
```
public static final Pattern VALID_EMAIL_ADDRESS_REGEX =
  Pattern.compile("^[A-Z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Z0-9.-]+\\.[A-Z]{2,6}$", Pattern.CASE_INSENSITIVE);

public static boolean validate(String emailStr) {
Matcher matcher = VALID_EMAIL_ADDRESS_REGEX.matcher(emailStr);
return matcher.find();
}
```

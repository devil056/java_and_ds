## Day 11

1. Number of external nodes in a full binary tree with n internal nodes > **n+1**
2. A binary tree constructed with n nodes, each node has either 0 or 2 children. The maximum height of the tree
is >> **(n-1)/2**
3. In a full binary search tree every internal node has 2 children, how many internal nodes are there for the 100 leaf nodes >> **99**
4. If n elements are sorted in a binary search tree . What would be the asymptotic complexity to search a key in the tree >> **O(n)**
5. Primary need of a binary tree being height balanced is >> **Avoid formation of the skew trees**
